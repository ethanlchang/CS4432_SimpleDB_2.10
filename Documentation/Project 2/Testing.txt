Before running the tests make sure you've already run the startup 
code to start the database.
Running the file Project2Tests runs the tests on the Database.
Test1 has no index
Test2 has a static hash index
Test3 has a extendible hash index
Test4 has a b-tree index

You can change the max size variable in the Project2Tests class to edit
how big the tables are. The lower this is the faster it will run but the
less of a difference the indices will show.
(10,000 takes about mins on my computer)

The output should look something  like this:
  Test1 Query took: 235
  Test2 Query took: 8
  Test3 Query took: 17
  Test4 Query took: 13
  Test1 Join took: 5
  Test2 Join took: 7
  Test3 Join took: 8
  Test4 Join took: 6
