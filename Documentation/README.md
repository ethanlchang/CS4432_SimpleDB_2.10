Project 1: 

To start you must run the startup program 
(SimpleDB_2.10\src\simpledb\server\Startup)

Then the server should be running fine. Now 
you can run the examples or the testing program
located (SimpleDB_2.10\Examples\Examples) and
(SimpleDB_2.10\Testing\Testing). Eamples will run
and say whats its doing and display the output
for these queries. The testing file will say what
query its testing and whether or not it passed 
the test for correctness. 
(STARTUP MUST BE RUNNING FOR THIS)
