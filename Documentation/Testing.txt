To make sure SimpleDB still works as it did originally, we run
the example SQL we originally wrote in Examples.java along
with a couple more SQL queries.

The buffer information from running these tests (as well as Startup)
also allows us to see how the new features work.

========================================================================================================================

Finding an empty frame:
This only happens in Startup, since it fills up the buffers,
meaning by the time we run Testing.java, it will only be using
the clock replacement policy.

Each time a buffer is pinned, it grabs the first available on
the list, here it grabs 0, then 1, then 2. When a buffer is
unpinned, it moves the end of the list so that it will always
cycle through all empty frames before clock replacement.

The section below is from the beginning of init from Startup.

Clock Replacement Policy:
We implemented a clock policy that acts on our list of
available buffers. The section below has the clock
pointer pointing to index 4, or buffer 0 after
unpinning buffer 1. The next command attempts a pin,
where it check buffer 0, unpinned, decrements its clock count by 1,
then increments clock point. Then it repeats through buffers
4, 5, 3, and then 6, all unpinned. 4, 5, and 3 have a clock count of 1, which
are alos reduced to 0. 6, however, has a clock count of 0, allowing it to
take a new block of data. This is shown by buffer 6 being removed from
available buffers and buffer 6 reporting as pinned and clock count 1.
