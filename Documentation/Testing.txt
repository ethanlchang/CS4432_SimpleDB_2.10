Testing.txt

To make sure SimpleDB still works as it did originally, we run
the example SQL we originally wrote in Examples.java

The buffer information from running these tests (as well as Startup)
also allows us to see how the new features work.

========================================================================================================================

Finding an empty frame:
This only happens in Startup, since it fills up the buffers,
meaning by the time we run Testing.java, it will only be using
the clock replacement policy.

Each time a buffer is pinned, it grabs the first available on
the list, here it grabs 0, then 1, then 2. When a buffer is
unpinned, it moves the end of the list so that it will always
cycle through all empty frames before clock replacement.
